Welcome
=======

This is a logic gate board written in Java. It can be used to simulate various logic gates like AND, OR, Comparators etc.
It was first written to replace a educational tool we had to use, which had some 'features' we found were really annoying.

Feel free to experiment with various gate or adding gates yourself.
My personal goal is to be able to control the RPi GPIO ports with this board and control something with logic gates instead of programming.

I hope you will enjoy it :)
